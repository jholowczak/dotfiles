# dotfiles
## Install
Clone this repository using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/jholowczak/dotfiles $HOME/.dotfiles`
## Usage
Change into the newly created `$HOME/.dotfiles` directory and run `make installdeps && make install`.
Note: Stow will fail if the target directories exist, so they must be removed before stow will work properly.
### Note on editors
Currently trying out emacs, so nvim configs will not be updated as often
